## Instructor: [Reginald Dawson][instructor url]


Semantic UI is a CSS framework with a unique, programmer-friendly concept. With Semantic UI, you describe what each part of your interface is *for*, and the framework will use that information to decide how it *looks*. Classes are simple and readable, and use a very natural syntax. 

In this course, you'll learn how to use Semantic UI in your web app projects. You'll see how easy it is to create a great interface with Semantic, how to use its many unique components, and how to use themse to modify every part of the default look and feel. Not only that, but you'll get to see how Semantic is integrated in three different front-end environments: Angular 2, React, and vanilla JavaScript.


## Source Files Description


This repository contains the three projects that we build throughout the course: one using Angular 2, one using React and one using vanilla JavaScript.
